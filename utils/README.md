GenerateTestData.py was developed by a student while working at OASIS over the summer.
We have found it useful for generating test data.

We have written an example test script which uses the above script and runs some tests

Before you can use it you must ensure all the python modules required are installed and
also the data directory must exist

We are making it available to the community for generating test data.
